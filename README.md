This project was a part of a course project for Robot Dynamics. The thesis for this work can be found ![here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gtGpLF94630I-FlDSARob_NYjZIFWMft/view?usp=sharing)

This project implements the simulation of a hardware platform that mimics the motion of an organ with involuntary motions. The application of this system is in training autonomous surgical robots or even human surgeons for surgery on organs like the lungs and heart.
