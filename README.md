This project was a part of a course project for Robot Dynamics. The report for this work can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gtGpLF94630I-FlDSARob_NYjZIFWMft/view?usp=sharing)

This project implements the simulation of a hardware platform that mimics the motion of an organ with involuntary motions. The application of this system is in training autonomous surgical robots or even human surgeons for surgery on organs like the lungs and heart.

## Data Acquisition and Processing
Free breathing motion data was used to obtain xyz position data for the platform simulation. After processing and trimming the data as needed, 480 points were obtained for a sampling time of 0.25s. The following graph shows the plotted xyz points for the data.
